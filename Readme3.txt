## **Project Title**
AWS Lambda Functions for Number Operations and S3 File Upload

## **Description**
This project consists of two AWS Lambda functions designed to perform specific tasks: one for adding two numbers and returning the result, and another for uploading files to an Amazon S3 bucket. The first function takes two numbers as input and returns their sum in a JSON format. The second function decodes a base64 encoded file content and uploads it to a specified S3 bucket. This project demonstrates the use of AWS Lambda for serverless computing and AWS S3 for file storage.

## **Installation Instructions**
To set up and deploy these AWS Lambda functions, follow these steps:

1. **Set Up AWS Account:**
   - Ensure you have an AWS account. If you donâ€™t have one, sign up at [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/).

2. **Install AWS CLI:**
   - Install the AWS Command Line Interface (CLI) on your local machine. Follow the instructions [here](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/).

3. **Configure AWS CLI:**
   - Configure the AWS CLI with your credentials.
   ```bash
   aws configure
   ```

4. **Create an S3 Bucket:**
   - Create an S3 bucket where files will be uploaded. You can do this via the AWS Management Console or using the AWS CLI.
   ```bash
   aws s3 mb s3://your-bucket-name
   ```

5. **Set Environment Variables:**
   - For the S3 upload function, set the environment variable `BUCKET_NAME` to your S3 bucket name.

6. **Deploy Lambda Functions:**
   - You can deploy the Lambda functions using the AWS Management Console or by using AWS SAM (Serverless Application Model) or AWS CloudFormation.

## **Usage Instructions**
- **Adding Two Numbers:**
  - To use the number addition function, invoke the Lambda function with a JSON payload containing `num1` and `num2`. For example:
  ```json
  {
      "num1": 5,
      "num2": 10
  }
  ```
  - The function will return a JSON response with the result:
  ```json
  {
      "statusCode": 200,
      "body": "{\"result\": 15}"
  }
  ```

- **Uploading Files to S3:**
  - To upload a file, invoke the S3 upload function with a JSON payload containing `file_name` and `file_content` (base64 encoded). For example:
  ```json
  {
      "file_name": "example.txt",
      "file_content": "SGVsbG8gd29ybGQh"  // Base64 for "Hello world!"
  }
  ```
  - The function will return a success message:
  ```json
  {
      "statusCode": 200,
      "body": "{\"message\": \"File example.txt uploaded successfully to your-bucket-name.\"}"
  }
  ```

## **Features**
- **Number Addition Functionality:** 
  - A simple Lambda function that takes two numbers as input and returns their sum in a JSON format.

- **File Upload to S3:**
  - A Lambda function that decodes base64 encoded file content and uploads it to an S3 bucket, providing a message upon successful upload.

- **Serverless Architecture:**
  - Both functions are designed to run in a serverless environment, allowing for easy scaling and reduced operational overhead.

- **JSON Responses:**
  - Both functions return responses in JSON format, making it easy to integrate with other applications or services.

- **Environment Variable Configuration:**
  - The S3 upload function uses environment variables for configuration, allowing for flexibility in deployment across different environments.
